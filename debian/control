Description: Toolkit for Django (Python) based GUI applications 
 The approach: a easy and quick possibility to create browser based
 application.
 Includes a shellserver: a daemon waits for predefined tasks written
 as Bash scripts. The communication (in both directions) is done by
 files. Tasks can be executed as root or as another user.
